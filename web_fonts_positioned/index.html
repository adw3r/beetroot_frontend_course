                React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React
                and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
                platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
                components: <i>bundles of reusable, nestable code</i>. You can learn more about React in the
                next
                section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.

                React Native runs on <a href="#" class="underline">React</a>, a popular open source library for
                building
                user interfaces with JavaScript.
                To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you
                started
                or can serve as a refresher course.
            </p>
            <p>
                We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
                approachable creatures that need names and a caf√© to work in.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside
                JavaScript
                like so: <code class="code">&lt;Text>Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The React docs have <a href="#" class="underline">a comprehensive guide</a> to JSX you can refer
                to
                learn even more. Because JSX is
                JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <code
                    class="code">name</code>
                for
                the cat, name, and
                embedding it with curly braces inside <code class="code">&lt;Text&gt;</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components
                render,
                state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
                changes
                over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!

        <section class="chapter" id="handling-text-input">
            <hgroup>
                <h2>handling text input</h2>

            </hgroup>
            <p>
                TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <i>onChangeText</i>
                prop
                that
                takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
                takes a
                function to be called when the text is submitted.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                language.
                In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there
                Bob"
                would be translated as "üçï üçï".
